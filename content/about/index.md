# About Me

👋Hello, I am Rohit Mehta from New Delhi, India. I am currently a full-time BSc (Hons) Electronics student who is currently self studying Computer Science through [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). And I am also learning Web Development through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) on the side.

🌱 I love to learn new things and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

I speak: हिन्दी (native), English (fluent), 日本語 (conversational).

Most of my projects are on [GitHub](https://github.com/r0hitm). And sometimes I make games and upload it to [🎮itch.io](https://avatar-hiro.itch.io/) for everyone to play.
