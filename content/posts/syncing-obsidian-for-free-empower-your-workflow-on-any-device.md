[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is more than just a note-taking appâ€”it's a powerful tool for organizing your thoughts and ideas. In this blog post, I'll be sharing my personal setup for syncing Obsidian notes between multiple devices (except iPhone) using Git and GitHub.
**Prerequisites**: I assume that you can work with basic CLI and are familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Table of Contents

## Desktop (PC or Mac)

Assuming you have Git installed and configured with your username and email (using the same email associated with your GitHub account), follow these steps:

1. Open your Notes vault using the command-line interface (CLI) and initialize it as a Git repository.

2. Create a `.gitignore` file and add the following content to it:

```plaintext
.obsidian/workspace-mobile.json
.obsidian/workspace.json
.obsidian/workspaces.json
.obsidian/cache
.trash/
.DS_Store
```

1. Commit all the changes you made.

2. Create a remote GitHub repository and set it as the upstream for your local Notes vault.

3. Install the Obsidian Git community plugin in Obsidian. This plugin will automatically commit and push any changes you make to your GitHub repository.
4. Adjust the commit and push frequency according to your preference in the plugin settings.

**Note 1**: If like me, you have gpg commit signing enabled for all your repositories, you may want to consider disabling it specifically for your Notes vault. This is because gpg commit signing can either prevent commits (due to the lack of a TTY) or require you to enter your passphrase frequently, which can be quite inconvenient. Disable using `git config commit.gpgsign false`.

**Note 2**: Obsidian uses LF line endings, so it might break the newline characters on devices that use different line endings (say Windows and Mac) because on Windows, git auto converts LF line endings to CRLF (windows default). If you run into this issue, make sure you disable `autocrlf` using: `git config core.autocrlf false`.

## Android

To sync your Obsidian notes on Android, follow these steps:

1. Install Termux and Termux Widget Addon from F-Droid.

2. Run the following commands in Termux (customize them based on your specific case):

```bash
# Grant storage access
# The following also creates symlink ~/storage/shared that points to
# the internal storage of the device
$ termux-setup-storage

$ pkg upgrade
$ pkg install gnupg openssh git gh

# (optional) If you have GPG commit signing keys, import them.

# Authenticate Termux using GitHub CLI.
$ gh auth login
# Use SSH for repository access when prompted by the command.
# This automatically sets up a SSH key and adds to your GitHub Account.

# Configure your Git settings (or copy .gitconfig from PC to ~)

# Now, navigate to ~/storage/shared and clone your notes.
$ cd ~/storage/shared
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-NOTES-REPO

# It is likely that you'll get following error & git will not work
$ cd Notes
$ git status
fatal: detected dubious owenership in repository at '<LOCATION>'

To add an exception for this repository, call:
     git config --global --add safe.directory <LOCATION>

# Go ahead and run this command.

# Finally, disable commit signing (see the last paragraph of pervious section)
$ git config commit.gpgsign false
```

Unfortunately, Obsidian Git doesn't work on mobile devices as intended and it's best to check the `Disable on this Device` of the plugin for the mobile devices.

### Making syncing a click away

I use a script to sync my notes using [Termux](https://termux.dev) (Get the F-Droid version, it's more up to date). It's possible to automate this script using Tasker or a cron job, to run in the background constantly.
To preserve battery life, I prefer using the `Termux:Widget` addon to create a launcher icon for the script. I place it beside Obsidian icon on my home screen. This way, my notes sync only when I need them, saving precious battery power.

You can refer to the wiki for more Termux:widget options. But here is my minimal working setup:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.shortcuts
$ chmod 700 -R ~/.shortcuts

# Use any editor to copy the sync script,
# I am using neovim (pkg install neovim)
$ nvim ~/.shortcuts/sync.bash

# Copy over the sync-script see below.

# After saving, fix shebangs (Termux specific thing)
$ termux-fix-shebang ~/.shortcuts/sync.bash
```

### Sync Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NOTES_DIR=~/storage/shared/Notes # Path to your Notes

cd $NOTES_DIR

timestamp=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d %H-%M-%S')

git pull
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Failed to pull changes from the remote repository."
    exit 1
fi

# Commit and Push local changes
if [[ $(git status --porcelain | wc -l) -ne 0 ]]; then
    git add -A
    git commit -a -m "Android Vault Sync: $timestamp"
    git push
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Error: Failed to push local changes."
        exit 1
    fi
fi

git pull
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Failed to pull changes after committing."
    exit 1
fi

echo "Sync completed successfully."
read -n 1 -s -r -p "Press any key to exit..."
```
