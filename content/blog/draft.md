This is a draft post, for sole purpose of reminding me how to use frontmatter. I will delete it later, as
I get comfortable with 11ty and configs of this site bootstrapped with eleventy-base-blog.

Remove `draft: true` from frontmatter to publish this post.

If `date` is not specified, it will be set to the date of the file creation.
I will use `date` to set the date of the post to the date of publication when I remove `draft: true` from frontmatter.
