Hi, I'm Rohit Mehta, a passionate computer scientist. I love to build things, automate boring & repetitive things, and I am constantly learning and challenging my technical skills. I can overcome any challenge with patience and perseverance.

In simpler terms, I’m a big fan of all things tech!

Outside of programming, I enjoy anime, the Legend of Zelda series, music, and anything cute and creative. I’m currently learning Japanese (N3 level) and may write articles (i11n) in Japanese in the future—後で記事も日本語で書くかもしれない。

Currently, I'm working as the Lead Front-End Developer at a startup based in the Netherlands.

I like meeting new people, feel free to shoot me a DM!
