Hi, I'm Rohit! I'm currently 3rd year BSc (Hons) Electronics student with a fervor for computers and technology ever since high school. My journey involves self-studying Computer Science through programs [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) and [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/). I am driven by a curiosity that compels me to experiment with and explore technology continually.

My favorite thing about this field is the delightful combination of creativity and real-world problem-solving—a unique blend that keeps me engaged and motivated.

### Skills

- **Programming Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** React, Django, Flask, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap
- **Databases:** SQLite, Firebase, Appwrite
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **Operating Systems:** Linux, Windows
- **Editors:** VS Code, Neovim (Vim)
- **UI/UX:** Figma, GIMP

### Recent Projects

- Recently, I created a web application using React and Appwrite for tracking subscriptions, developed within a hackathon I participated in two months ago.
- Another notable project is a todo app using React, TypeScript and Firebase.

Both applications use the modern v6 syntax for the react-router and custom hooks around Appwrite and firebase for better code organization.
