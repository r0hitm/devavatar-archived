## 🙏 Credits

These are the awesome people who have helped me in building my blogs.

- **My friend [Manmeet Singh](https://github.com/manmeet-ms)**: For UI/UX redesign or components and a cool logo.
- **Template [astro-paper](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper)**: For the initial template and inspiration.

Let's not forget the amazing people behind the tools and libraries I used to build this website, to name a few, Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Vite, ... checkout the `package.json` on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r0hitm/devavatar) for the full list.

Another special mention to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), my go-to for organizing my knowledge and thoughts, that I configured to write my blogs as well! 🚀
