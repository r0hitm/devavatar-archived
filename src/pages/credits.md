These are the awesome people and/or resources that helped me set up this website.

- [**Manmeet Singh**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manmeets-/): My designer friend who helped me with the logo and footer redesign.
- [**astro-paper**](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper): The Astro theme I used as a base with my modifications.
- **Obsidian**: My go-to for organizing my knowledge and thoughts, that I configured for writing my blogs as well!

And the tools & libraries: Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Vite, etc. Checkout the `package.json` on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/r0hitm/devavatar) for the full list.
