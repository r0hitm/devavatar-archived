So, after careful consideration, I have decided to drop using Duolingo. Here's my reasoning:

Reliance on translations: Duolingo's heavy emphasis on translations _prevents _(or at least _hinders_) me from developing a direct connection to the mental image of Japanese. (First biggest turnoff)

Lack of insight into grammar and sentence structure: Duolingo's approach focuses more on providing memorized sentence formation rules rather than building a deep understanding of grammar and sentence structure.

Designed for English speakers: As a native Hindi speaker, it's frustrating that Duolingo disregards the few similarities between Hindi and Japanese. It forces me to route my thinking through English. Just To be clear, I am not talking about the interface language being in English. (Second biggest turnoff)

Inconsistent daily goals: increasing daily XP limits and time-consuming tasks have become tedious. It no longer aligns with my learning preferences and available time, making the whole experience more burdensome.

Doubts about pronunciations: Over time, I've started to lose trust in Duolingo's pronunciation exercises. Initially, this was one of the reasons I installed the app

While there are some reasons to consider keeping Duolingo, such as being my only current engagement in Japanese learning at the moment, familiarity with certain expressions and patterns, acceptable listening exercises, and the fear of losing my 410-day streak.

I believe the drawbacks of keep using Duolingo for Japanese has outweighed the benefits for me
