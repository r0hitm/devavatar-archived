> Very powerful idiom.
>
> - if a function has no side-effects & does not read mutable memory, then no point in computing it again for the same argument, instead **cache** it
> - trade-off is storage required for cache - but it's cheap these days
> - similar to promises but different
> - for recursive functions, makes them *exponentially* faster
